## Overview 
This is a simple example showing how to use the file system api to provide a "save as" style save button. 

## Video Tutorial
There is a free coding byte video tutorial on this code which can be found [here](https://beckhoff-au.teachable.com/admin/courses/1204981/curriculum/lectures/37475204)

## Getting Started
Activate and run the PLC project.  Open Main.view in liveview, swap live view to a real browser (as normal live view does not support loading) and load the example.json file by pressing the load button.  Pressing save will open the file save dialog.

## Code Snippets
The following section of code is the mechanisim behind the reading and saving. 
```javascript
TcHmi.Symbol.readEx2('%s%PLC1.GVL.myArray%/s%', function(data) {
    if (data.error === TcHmi.Errors.NONE) {
        // Handle result value... 
        var value = data.value;

        var data = JSON.stringify(value, null, 2);
        var file = new Blob([data]);
        var writableFile = {};

        const options = {
            types: [{
                description: 'Json Files',
                accept: {
                    'text/plain': ['.json'],
                },
            }, ],
        };

        window.showSaveFilePicker(options).then(function(fileHandle) {
            console.log('We now have a file handle');
            return fileHandle.createWritable()

        }).then(function(writable) {
            writableFile = writable;
            return writableFile.write(file);

        }).then(function(respose) {
            console.log('Closing File');
            return writableFile.close();

        }).then(function(respose) {
            console.log("Save Complete");

        }).catch(function(respose) {
            console.log(respose);
            console.log("Save Failed");
        });

    } else {
        // Handle error... 
    }
});
```
